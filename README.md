### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently focused on exploring the relationship between Soil Health and various factors such as C&N biogeochemistry, land use, management, microbes & metabolites, crop yield, and climate.
- ðŸŒ± As a soil scientist, I'm deeply intrigued by the intersection of data science and soil science.
- ðŸ‘¯ Additionally, I'm actively learning web development using Python and JavaScript.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at saurav12das@gmail.com or sdas4@unl.edu.
