Hi there! ğŸ‘‹
ğŸ”­ I'm currently focused on exploring the relationship between Soil Health and various factors such as C&N biogeochemistry, land use, management, microbes & metabolites, crop yield, and climate.
ğŸŒ± As a soil scientist, I'm deeply intrigued by the intersection of data science and soil science.
ğŸ‘¯ Additionally, I'm actively learning web development using Python and JavaScript.
